Integration. It's not the most fun part of software development, but it is one of the more critical things you need to think about as you are looking at purchasing a cloud-based product. Cloud products are great in the sense that you don't have to manage the infrastructure yourself, you get new features quickly, and you are able to convert a fixed capital cost over to a variable expense (for the MBAs in the audience). However, the success or failure of your cloud acquisition is going to be tied to how successful you are in integrating your new cloud platform into your overall business processes/workflows and the IT ecosystem of your organization. You need to understand that there are different styles of integrations and every cloud provider will give you different technologies to use with these styles. 

This article is going to walk through what are the different styles of cloud integration and talk specifically about which Genesys Cloud technologies are available for each integration style.  

:::{"alert":"info","title":"On building distributed applications","autoCollapse":false}
The integration styles defined in this article are meant to be a very broad-based definition of integration types. I have not made any direct attempt to tie these broad styles into the more traditional enterprise integration patterns found in Gregor Hohope and Bobby Wolfe's seminal book on integration: [Enterprise Integration Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/o/asin/0321200683/ref=nosim/enterpriseint-20). The patterns defined in this book are still very relevant, but tend to be more fine-grained and focused on integration patterns of systems within the four walls of an organization. If you are interested in finding out more about these patterns, I also recommend visiting the [companion web-site](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) for the book.  
:::

There are three broad styles of integration. These three styles are defined by what you are trying to accomplish:

1. **Behavioral**. "I want my cloud provider to do something on behalf of my user or process." For example, when the user clicks on a button in my home-grown CRM, I might have it call a Genesys Cloud API to save some data and carry out a set of business logic.

2. **Data**. "I want to move data in and out of my cloud provider." Examples of this include: I need to pull all of the days conversations out of Genesys Cloud for my contact center and synchronize that data with my local data warehouse or I am building a near-time alerting dashboard for shift supervisors.

3. **Presentation**. "I want to embed my application within my cloud provider's user interface or I want part of my cloud provider's user interface embedded within my application." An example of this would be integrating Genesys Cloud's call-controls into your organization's home-grown CRM so agents can take and receive calls right within the CRM.

Let's walk through these styles in more detail.

## Behavioral Integration Style

The behavioral integration style is when you need to integrate programmatically with your cloud provider so that the provider will execute some action on your behalf. These actions are characterized as:

1. **Focusing on having the cloud provider do something for you**. With a behavior integration style, you are usually asking a cloud provider to take some action on behalf of an individual user or a process. For example, you might want to call a cloud provider to save a piece of data, apply business rules along with it, or look up of a customer record.

2. **Being short-lived in nature and point-to-point**. Behavioral integrations are application-oriented and tend to favor single calls out to an API that return very quickly from a call. They are considered point-to-point because the your application(s) are directly calling an endpoint on the cloud provider without a middle-man (e.g., a queue or service bus intermediating the call.)

3. **Are transactionally focused, rather then data synchronization focused**. One thing that many people find confusing is that APIs can be used for transactional actions as well as for data synchronization. Behavioral integrations styles are not data synchronization focused.

Genesys Cloud Offers three different mechanisms for carrying out behavioral integration styles. They include:

1. REST-based APIs
2. Data Actions
3. Webhooks

### REST-based APIs

Genesys Cloud is an API-first platform. All of the business logic, workflows, and processes carried out in Genesys Cloud are exposed as REST-based web services. The Genesys Cloud UI is built on the same APIs that we expose to our customers. We offer a very wide variety of APIs to carry out common business tasks and we even have had some customers who have completely forgone the use of the Genesys Cloud UI and instead have completely built end-user facing applications on Genesys Cloud APIs. Most of our APIs are built around a synchronous request-response model. There are several things you need to keep in mind when looking at using our API.  First, you are integrating over the internet using a distributed web protocol. You need to take into account that failures can occur and you need to build into your application common API invocation best practices like timeouts, retry, circuit breakers, bulkheads, fallback calls, and caching when calling Genesys Cloud APIs.

Cloud-based applications are distributed applications and the integrations built for them must take failure into account. If you are not familiar with the concepts of timeouts, retry, circuit breakers, bulkheads, etc., I highly recommend you take a look Michael Nygard's book [Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready software](https://www.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software-ebook/dp/B079YWMY2V/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwz6_8BRBkEiwA3p02Vf8U0Mcz2-JXH9NlvRRKU5UE_NzqqEl879lei8Ln9opK-wZBaAld2BoC_loQAvD_BwE&hvadid=250075996547&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9009669&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=6812719388737011366&hvtargid=kwd-404904995006&hydadcr=22562_10354930&keywords=release+it+2nd+edition&qid=1603059694&sr=8-2&tag=googhydr-20) 

Michael covers the challenges of building distributed systems in detail and also walks through many of the techniques I have referenced above.

The second thing you need to consider is how quickly you are going consume the Genesys Cloud APIs and at what volume. As a general policy, Genesys does not try to monetize the invocation of their APIs. However, we do implement [API rate limiting](/api/rest/rate_limits.html) and [API fair usage](/api/rest/v2/organization/limits.html) policies to protect the overall integrity of the Genesys Cloud platform and ensure that Genesys Cloud consumers are consuming APIs responsibly. Before you undertake a new integration, make sure you understand:

1.  The criticality of the API call within your workflow and protect your application appropriately.
2.  The API invocation density of your integration. How quickly will your integration invoke an API?
3.  The API invocation volume of your integration. Will your integration inadvertently consume your API fair use allocation for the month?

Additional information about the Genesys Cloud platform API can be found [here](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/api/). 

### Data Actions

[Data actions](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/about-genesys-cloud-data-actions-integration/) allow you to declaratively invoke a third-party web service or even a Genesys platform API from within a Genesys Cloud script, dialer flow, or  pre-call rule. Genesys Cloud data actions are not invoked like the Genesys Cloud REST APIs. Instead they are configured through the Genesys Cloud UI and the mapping of the request and response for the invocation is performed through JSON-Path transformations. Genesys Cloud offers a number of predefined data actions for third-party vendors including:  SalesForce, ZenDesk and Adobe. In addition, if a predefined data action does not exist within Genesys Cloud, you can configure a generic action to invoke a web service or an AWS Lambda.

### Webhooks
There is a third class of API-integrations supported within Genesys Cloud: webhooks. A webhook is a user-defined callback where the a user of a cloud-based platform registers an HTTP-based (usually JSON-based) web service that will be called by the cloud-service provider back into the user's application. This is the reverse of what normally happens so rather then user calling an API on the cloud-provider, the cloud-provider calls a web service within the user's data center. Webhooks are most commonly used when you are integrating system-to-system and you want to post the results of a workflow over to another workflow.

Genesys Cloud uses webhooks in two places within the platform. The first place is that Genesys Cloud exposes the ability to [post notifications](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/add-webhook-integration/) about an external event to a group chat room within Genesys Cloud. Some examples of this type of integration includes posting alerts from online alerting systems like [Pagerduty](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/set-pagerduty-integration/) or build notification results from Continuous Integration/Continuous Deploys (CI/CD) platforms like [Jenkins](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/set-jenkins-integration/).

The second use for webhooks within Genesys Cloud is with our [Predictive Engagement](https://all.docs.genesys.com/ATC/Current/AdminGuide/Overview) feature. Predictive Engagement provides analytics and predictive engagement capabilities within Genesys Cloud and uses webhooks to send the data it collects to your internal CRM or back office application.

## Data Integration Style

When I was early in my career working for a consulting company, my manager at a client site once said something very profound to me.  He said "Code changes, but data is forever. You will spend a large amount of your career moving data from one spot to another." That single comment has run true over the course of my entire career and reflects the reality of cloud-based integrations. Most integrations are going to be how you are going to get data out of your cloud provider and feed it to other systems within your IT ecosystem.

There are a lot of different mechanisms for pulling data out of a cloud provider. However, when we talk specifically about how we do it in Genesys Cloud, the topic of data integration centers around the Genesys Cloud [Analytics API](/api/rest/v2/analytics/overview.html) and event-based [Notifications](/api/rest/v2/notifications/notification_service.html).  

### Polling for Data with the Analytics API

The Analytics API is not a monolithic API, but rather encompasses three levels of data detail:

1. [Observations](/api/rest/v2/analytics/overview.html#instantaneous_observations_metrics).  The Observation APIs return information about the current state of objects within Genesys Cloud. Observation queries are meant to be a point in time snapshot of what is going on in your contact center. They offer limited filtering and no date-based queries.
2. [Aggregate](/api/rest/v2/analytics/overview.html#aggregate_metrics). The Aggregate APIs return a summarized view of your call center data over time with the ability to collect the data in time buckets. This API has a rich query language which allows you to "slice-and-dice" the data across different dimensions.
3. [Detail](/api/rest/v2/analytics/overview.html#detail_record_metrics). The Details APIs offer a fine-grained level of detail of the user and conversation details. It acts as a ledger of all activity associated with conversations and users. The detail records represent the building a block of a conversation which means there can be multiple pieces of data being retrieved for the same conversation.

The `Observation` APIs are generally used for building real-time dashboards and this API type can be polled periodically to retrieve data about flows, queues and user status (within the limits of API rate limits and API fair usage). The `Aggregate` APIs are really designed for "ad-hoc" query-based applications where you are doing some basic presentation of aggregate data. 

The `Detail` APIs is where new Genesys Cloud integrators tend to run into trouble. The `Detail` APIs offer a rich amount of conversation and user data. Since this an easy-to-code-to API with a lot of the data integrators are looking for, many integrators try to use this API to do regular pulls of large amounts of data with the desire to sync that detailed conversation data back to their own data stores, data warehouses, or data lakes.  Unfortunately, many new Genesys Cloud integration developers quickly run into [API rate limits](/api/rest/rate_limits.html) and [API fair-usage limits](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/api-on-demand-charge/) because of the amount of paginated data they need to pull back for these large data queries.  Each call to retrieve a page of data is an API call that runs against your rate-limits and API fair-usage allocations.

The Analytics team does offer a asynchronous version of the `Detail` APIs, called the [Jobs](/api/rest/v2/analytics/overview.html#synchronous_vs_asynchronous_data_access) APIs. These endpoints allow a developer to issue a query and have the API immediately return with a 202 HTTP status code. The integrator can then periodically check back to see if the query is complete. The `Jobs` endpoint is much more efficient in terms of computing resources, but the data it returns can be up to 24 hours old.

### Into the Event Stream
So how do you deal with situations where you have low-data latency data requirements? Polling for this data using the Analytics API introduces timeout problems and using the `Jobs` endpoints means you can not retrieve the most current data. Genesys Cloud offers an event-based message stream that will publish conversation and user detail messages at the time the event occurs. There are two mechanisms for consuming these messages streams:

1. The WebSocket-Based Notification Services
2. AWS EventBridge

The WebSocket-based [Notifications](/api/rest/v2/notifications/notification_service.html) service allows you to open a web socket to Genesys Cloud and subscribe to events as they occur. Events will be published to the WebSocket. This web socket does not guarantee message delivery and if the web socket is disconnected at the time message is published, it will be lost. This puts the onus on you as the developer to maintain socket state and to build data recovery code if the socket becomes unavailable. For example, if you are building an application that is listening for conversation details event over a web socket and you lose the web socket connection, when you re-establish the connection, you would need to use the Analytics `Details` API to retrieve any conversation data that was missed from when the web socket went down and a new socket was established.

The second approach for consuming events is using the AWS EventBridge. Using AWS EventBridge, notifications from Genesys Cloud are published to AWS and then forwarded to a target object within the customer's AWS account. This target can be a Kinesis stream that can fire a Lambda or write the data to S3.  While using AWS EventBridge requires an AWS account, Genesys Cloud will attempt to deliver a message to EventBridge 7 times during a 24 hour period.  Once the message hits Kinesis, you as the integrator can configure your Kinesis stream to persist the data for up to 7 days. The AWS EventBridge is about to enter beta - watch for new documentation on this integration technology shortly.

With both approaches, the integrator will get the detailed records for the individual parts of the user and conversation. This means that if you want to see all parts of the conversation, it will be your responsibility to "stitch" the data together to present a complete view.

## Presentation Integration Style

The last integration style is presentation integration. This type of integration involves embedding user interface components from the cloud provider inside your own application or embedding your own application components inside the cloud provider's tool. Every cloud provider is going to offers a wide variety of options to do this. Genesys Cloud categorizes their presentation integration capabilities into two buckets:

1. Agent based UI integrations
2. End User based UI integrations

For agent-based UI, Genesys cloud offers a number of different capabilities. For embedding custom applications within Genesys Cloud, you can leverage the [Client Apps](/api/client-apps/) framework. This framework allows you to embed an entire application as a sidebar or full frame application within the Genesys Cloud user interface. For embedding Genesys Cloud functionality inside your own applications, you can leverage the [Embeddable Framework](/api/embeddable-framework/). In addition, if you want to embed Genesys Cloud phone controls via WebRTC into your own applications, you can leverage the [WebRTC SDK](/api/webrtcsdk/).

The above technologies specifically focus on building presentation capabilities for agents. For end-user integrations, Genesys Cloud provides our chat SDKs. Our current [chat](/api/webchat/) SDK provides the ability to embed chat integrations with Genesys Cloud-based agents directly in your customer facing applications. This chat API provides basic chat capabilities. The Genesys Cloud chat team is working on a next-generation Web Messaging that will provide rich-media capabilities for your chat integrations and will be hitting beta shortly.

## Closing thoughts
Wow!  I know I have thrown a lot of information at you, but the reality is that the topic of integration is a broad and deep one. In this article the three major styles of cloud-based integration were covered.  These integration styles are:

1. Behavioral
2. Data
3. Presentation

We also looked at the specific Genesys Cloud technologies that can be used to implement these different integration styles. The key things to remember is:

1.  **Take the time to understand what integration style you are using and select the right technology for implementation.** I have seen Genesys Cloud developers naturally gravitate to just using the APIs for integration without understanding the tradeoffs associated with the APIs they are using. The tradeoffs amongst the different integration technologies are not just technical. You have to keep mind such things as API rate limiting and API fair use policies.

2.  **Understand the failure modes for your integrations.** With APIs, remember that you have to make your applications resilient. Apply common resiliency patterns like circuit breakers and bulkheads to your integration code. For the WebSocket based integrations, leverage retry logic in your code and track disconnects and re-connects so you can automatically sync any data that was missed during a disconnected socket.

3. **Do not build everything yourself.** Familiarize yourself with the pre-built data actions already in Genesys Cloud and the third-party connectors and applications built by Genesys Cloud partners. These connectors and partners can be found at the Genesys Cloud [AppFoundry](https://appfoundry.genesys.com/filter/genesyscloud) website.
