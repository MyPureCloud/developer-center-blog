Greetings everyone. I hope everyone is keeping safe and healthy in these challenging times. We are officially three-fourths of the way through the year. 2021 is flying by and the third quarter of the year is now behind us. The Developer Engagement team and the rest of Genesys Cloud have been busy this year: new features, new development tools, and lots of new content. I wanted to take a moment and share with you a quick summary of everything the team has been working on in the third quarter of 2021.

## More Content, More Channels of Information
Our goal is to deliver timely, relevant, and consumable content for all the developers who use our site. We currently have 5 channels for delivering information about the Genesys Cloud development platform:

1. [__Developer Center__](/). Our Developer Center is the main portal for finding documentation around the Genesys Cloud APIs and development tools. It has a wide variety of topics dealing not only with the individual API calls, but also development guides on API integration, data integration, and Genesys Cloud development best practices. The Developer Center is the starting point for all developer content within Genesys Cloud. 

2. [__Genesys Cloud Developer Blog__](/blog/). The blog contains articles on various Genesys Cloud development topics. It covers a wide range of topics, including new developer tool announcements, best practices for building your contact center within Genesys Cloud and hands-on articles on how to use the Genesys Cloud APIs.

3. [__DevDrops__](/video/devdrops/). Our DevDrop series is a new video series that we released this year. Its focus is on delivering short, consumable videos (10-20 minutes in length) that are meant to be "developer-to-developer" conversations around specific developer-related topics. We are experimenting with our video formats and looking at how we can break down larger topics into smaller videos. 

4. [__DevCasts__](/video/devcasts/). Our DevCasts are our more traditional webinar topics that are approximately 45-60 minutes in lengths and allow for audience participation. They cover a wide variety of development topics and are not just limited to discussions related to platform APIs.

5. [__Blueprints__](/blueprints/). Blueprints are hands-on examples of how to integrate and extend Genesys Cloud functionality with other vendor products and technologies. The number of blueprints we have continues to grow in size and come from not only our development engagement team but also our developers, solution consultants, and partners.

Here is a summary of the content we delivered or are close to delivering this quarter:

| Content Name | Type | Description|
|--------------|------|------------|
|[New Experimental CLI Feature: Alternative Formats](2021-08-31-new-experimental-cli-feature-alternative-formats/)| Blog |We are constantly working to improve and try new things in our blog.

|[New Experimental CLI Feature: Transform Data](/blog/2021-10-01-experimental-feature-transform-data/)| Blog |This is one of the new features I am most excited about. With this feature, you now have the ability to define [Golang templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) to transform data coming out of the Genesys Cloud CLI. We also incorporate the [Sprig](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig) library into the templates to leverage a large set of pre-defined functions in your transformation templates. This allows you to more easily parse, transform and then redirect Genesys Cloud data returned by the CLI into a targeted format.|

With open messaging you can leverage Genesys Cloud's asynchronous ACD capabilities to route inbound open messages to the right queues and agents. Asynchronous messaging allows conversations to remain active, so that customers can continue conversations at their preferred pace. Additionally, you can use Inbound Message flows in Architect to route inbound open messages to integrations, bots, and queues based on message content.|

In addition to the content completed this quarter, here is some of the new content already being worked on for Q4 of this year.

| Content Name | Type | Description|
|--------------|------|------------|

## More Tools
The engineers in the Developer Engagement team have been heads down this quarter and have delivered several new capabilities. These new capabilities include:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|[Genesys Cloud CLI](/api/rest/command-line-interface/)|Several new features have been added to the CLI as experimental features. These new features include the ability input and output data in a YAML format. We have also included a new transform command that will let you pass the output of a CLI command to a GO template and transform the output. Finally, we now allow you to process multiple files residing in a single directory.|
|[CX as Code](/api/rest/CX-as-Code/)|We continue to build out the resources and data sources within our CX as Code DevOps tool. For a complete list of the published resources take a look at the [resource documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/MyPureCloud/genesyscloud/latest/docs)|
|[Account Switcher](/guides/quickstarts/developer-tools-intro)|The developer tools now allow you to set up multiple Genesys Cloud accounts within the developer tools and switch between those accounts without having to log out.|

## Whats Coming Up?

The Developer Engagement team is in full swing for this next quarter. Some of the things coming up for this next quarter include:

1. **New CX as Code integrations with Archy**. It's almost here. Our goal is to have Archy be able to be integrated into Terraform without the need to install and configure the Archy CLI to deploy flows. This new integration will significantly simplify the setup work needed to be done in your CI/CD pipeline.

2. **More CLI capabilities**. We are finalizing two new experimental features in the CLI. The first feature is the ability to process multiple files for a create or update command. Currently, the CLI can only process one file at a time and if you want to feed in multiple files for a create or update command you need to do some file listing and parsing magic using Unix or Powershell tools. This new command will let you process all of the files in a directory and apply the CLI command using each file. The second capability will allow an administrator to not only login into the CLI with an OAuth 2 Client Credentials Grant, but also an Implicit Grant (Browser) credential. This will allow Genesys Cloud the ability to log exactly "who" did what with the CLI rather than logging just a generic OAuth token. 

3. **A new API Explorer**. The Developer Engagement team is in the final stages of releasing a new version of its API Explorer. I just had a demonstration of it, I think our development community will love its amazing new features. Some of these new features include a redesigned wizard frontend for entering API data, stronger type checking, and the ability to embed the API Explorer directly in our technical documentation. Expect the beta to start soon. We would love feedback.


## Closing Thoughts
The Developer Engagement team has been roaring through this year and I am excited and proud to see the content and capabilities being produced by this team. I am also ecstatic with the growing developer community who is joining forces with us. Many of the features and content we build come directly from our day-to-day interactions with you. Please keep the feedback coming. Meet us in the [Developer Forum](/forum/). Let's build something great together.
