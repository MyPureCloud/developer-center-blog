Greetings.  I hope everyone is safe and healthy in these challenging times. Genesys Cloud has seen a tremendous amount of growth in the last three years.  As more and more organizations have seen the power of the Genesys Cloud platform and have embraced our open API approach to delivering a comprehensive customer experience, the Genesys Cloud leadership team has committed to continually invest in our development community and make sure their experiences with our product are unforgettable.  This investment includes the launching of a new team, the Genesys Cloud Developer Engagement team.

The Genesys Cloud Developer Engagement team is dedicated to connecting the Genesys Cloud development community to all of the technical expertise that exists within Genesys Cloud. Specifically, the Developer Engagement Team is responsible for: 

1. Developer Content
2. Content Management
3. Developer Tooling

In this blog post, we want to share some of the things you will be seeing throughout 2020 and 2021 from this newly formed team.

## Developer Content

**Content is king**.  We have a lot of really good content on our [Genesys Cloud developer center](https://developer.mypurecloud.com) site, but we can make it even better.  Starting now and throughout 2021, we are focused on building `Developer Starting Guides` that will comprehensively cover key development topics within Genesys Cloud.  These `Developer Starting Guides` will demonstrate in depth how to use the Genesys Cloud APIs to carry out tasks in such areas as:  User Provisioning, Analytics, Integration and Conversations.  These guides will not be the tightly focused tutorials we currently have, but will instead be much broader in their purview, showing developers how to leverage our APIs to "connect" the dots across all of our services.  

Our first `Developer Starting Guide` will cover user provisioning and will be available in the next month.  

In addition, we will be delivering more in-depth [Developer Blueprints](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/blueprints) that show you how to integrate Genesys Cloud with other vendors and really focus on delivering value faster to meet the needs of your customers.

In the end we are committed to delivering not only written tutorials, but full projects with code showing our APIs in action.  Nothing speaks truth better then working code.

## Content Management

In next 9 months, you are going to see a reorganization and relaunch of our [Genesys Cloud developer center](https://developer.mypurecloud.com) site.  Expect not only a new look and feel for the [Genesys Cloud developer center](https://developer.mypurecloud.com), but improvements to our search and navigation capabilities.  In addition, the Developer Engagement Team will be focused on how we can personalize your development experience so that no matter where you are at in developing with Genesys Cloud, we will always be presenting you with new and interesting material.

## Developer Tooling 

We get a lot of positive feedback on our developer tools.  We want to continue to build out these capabilities, by integrating them directly into our content and APIs. Our goal is to provide a seamless experience so that you can access the developer tools while reading and working through the content on the site.  In addition, we want to be able to expand our toolset by including new debugging and monitoring tools that will give you greater insight into how your applications are interacting with Genesys Cloud.

## Closing Thoughts

I am extremely excited with the formation of this new team.  Our team is considered a Research and Development group within Genesys and we are focused on changing the developer experience.  What makes this team unique, is that the members of our team are all software engineers who really love to code and share.  It's their passion and that passion is reflected in the work this new team does every day.  

I would love to hear from you and get your thoughts about our team and our mission.  Please feel to free to leave questions and comments in the discussion forum link at the bottom of this post. 
 
 **Let's build something great together.**
