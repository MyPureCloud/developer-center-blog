In the past, if our customers wanted to call a service that was behind their firewall and they did not want to expose it externally (to the internet), our customers needed to use our [Bridge Server](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/bridge-platform-overview/).
Using the Bridge Server prevented companies from having to figure out how to safely expose internal-only services.  

Once a Bridge Server was installed, customers could then install any number of "connectors" that added the functionality that they needed. 
One connector, the **Web Services Data Dip Connector**, allowed our customers to hit REST endpoints behind their firewall, and send the information 
back to their IVR.  This connector leveraged Genesys Cloud to define the information needed to perform the data 
retrieval (URL, request schema, response schema, etc.) This configuration is known as an "action" in the Genesys Cloud ecosystem.

This setup has worked well, however, it requires our customers to maintain these components.
For example, the Bridge Servers and connectors have to be updated regularly. Also, the Bridge Server lives on a Windows server 
that has to be updated regularly with security patches, etc. Basically, the Bridge Server is another component that requires oversight.


## A Simpler Alternative
Developers at Genesys set out to find a better solution to the problem of exposing local services securely without the need of 
a Bridge Server. In our efforts, we discovered ngrok. ngrok is a program that you can download and run locally that will 
instantly create a public HTTPS URL for a locally running web service. Unlike the Bridge Server, ngrok can run on Linux, 
Windows, or macOS. It does not require any connectors or robust hardware. ngrok connects to the "ngrok cloud service", 
which accepts traffic on a public address and relays that traffic to the ngrok process running on your machine and then 
to the local address that you specify. No SSL certificate, proxy, or fancy networking is needed. All of that is taken care 
of for you by ngrok.

Pairing ngrok with Genesys Cloud's data actions gives you the best of both worlds. You can integrate local services with Genesys Cloud 
and you do not need to write any additional code or set up complex networking rules. We tested it. This is what we didâ€¦

### Quick Start

#### Setup A Local Test Service
1. Download and install our sample test service: [Sample Service](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/webservice-data-dip-connector-example-node)
2. On this site, follow the directions under **Running the web service**. Once the service is running, it automatically adds one user available for testing.
2. Test using the following command:
    
```{"language":"bash"}
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/searchContactsByName -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"firstName": "Test"}'
```
 
#### Setup ngrok
 1. Install ngrok [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started)
 2. Make sure to ngrok is added your PATH
 3. You will need a token. (_See step 3 on ngrok install page_)
    
    **Production Tip:** _When running ngrok in a non-dev environment, you will need to upgrade your ngrok license to either the Pro or 
    Business plan. This will allow you to use TLS as well as use reserved domain names. When using the Free ngrok 
    version, the URL used will change every time you restart the ngrok process. More information can be found here: 
    [https://ngrok.com/pricing](https://ngrok.com/pricing)_
    
4. When you start ngrok, you can configure it by using command line params or by creating a configuration file. 
You can configure ngrok to use proxies, Basic auth, logging, etc. For more information, see [https://ngrok.com/docs#config-options](https://ngrok.com/docs#config-options).
5. Run this command to point to the service that you started above, which is listening on port 8080.

```{"language":"bash"}
ngrok http 8080 -bind-tls=true
```

6. Test ngrok's URL works with your test service

```{"language":"bash"}
curl -X POST https://478b91ce.ngrok.io/searchContactsByName -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"firstName": "Test"}'
```
    
####Create a Genesys Cloud Custom Action
1. Log into Genesys Cloud Admin
<img src="screenshot2.png" alt="Genesys Cloud Admin"  style="display:block;width: 60%;padding:10px;">
2. The custom Action we are going to setup needs to belong to a Genesys Cloud Integration. Let's create a test Integration..
    * **Click Integrations > Integrations**
    <img src="screenshot3.png" alt="Integrations Admin Page"  style="display:block;width: 60%;padding:10px;">
    * **Add a new Integration**
        1. Install **Web Services Data Actions**
        <img src="screenshot4.png" alt="Install Web Service Data Actions"  style="display:block;width: 20%;padding:10px;">
        2. Name the integration **"Test Local Service Integration"**
        3. Click Save
        4. Activate the integration by clicking the **Active** toggle.  
        ![Active](active.png)
    * **Create Custom Action**
        1. In Genesys Cloud Admin, go to **Integrations > Actions**
        <img src="screenshot5.png" alt="Genesys Cloud Actions"  style="display:block;width: 70%;padding:10px;">
        2. Click **Import**
        3. Import [importExample.json](./importExample.json)
        4. Select the Integration you created above. _(Test Local Service Integration)_
        5. Name your Action: **Action Test With ngrok**
        6. Click the **Setup** tab
            * Contracts define the request going to your service and the response that will be coming back. No changes are needed to Contracts.
            * Click the **Configuration** tab. Change **requestURLTemplate** to use the ngrok URL generated above. The entry will look like the following:

           ```
                 "requestUrlTemplate": "https://478b91ce.ngrok.io/searchContactsByName",
           ```
           
        7. To test, we are going to need to provide the values that our searchContactsByName service is going to require.
        
            * Click the **Test** tab and type **Test** for the first name and **Account** for last name. 
            <img src="screenshot6.png" alt="Genesys Cloud Actions"  style="display:block;width: 80%;padding:10px;">
            * Deselect **Flatten output** 
            * Click **Run Action**
            * In the results, you can expand the JSON to see the response that your web service returned. 
            
## Summary
This demonstrates how you can expose any local service to Genesys Cloud. Once Genesys Cloud can reach your service, you can access your data using
any of our tools, such as Architect and Scripter. This is a great alternative for services that are behind companies' firewalls 
and carries less tech burden than maintaining a Bridge Server. 

What is our relationship with ngrok?  Genesys is not affiliated with ngrok. We simply found this service extremely helpful and 
wanted to pass along the information to our customers!

_**Note**: For public-facing services, you should still use a [custom action in Genesys Cloud](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/create-custom-action-integrations/), 
but instead of using it with ngrok, use the service's public-facing URL._

## ngrok Tips
* When you start ngrok using command line arguments, the command will begin with:

```{"language":"bash"}
ngrok [protocol] [options] [address]
```
* When you start ngrok using file-based configurations, then you just specify the tunnel name.

```{"language":"bash"}
ngrok start [tunnel-name]
```
* By default, ngrok will forward any http or https traffic to the port specified in your ngrok configuration. If you only 
want listen for https traffic, set **bind_tls**: true in your configuration file, or if you are using command line, it 
will be **bind-tls=true**. (_notice the dash instead of underscore_)
* You can secure the ngrok address, by adding Basic Auth to it. 
  [https://ngrok.com/docs#expose](https://ngrok.com/docs#expose)
  
```{"language":"bash"}
	#Example ~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml
	authtoken: xxx
	tunnels:
	  actions:
	    proto: http
	    addr: 8080
	    bind_tls: true
	    subdomain: actions
	    auth: "demo:secret"
```
*  ngrok does not have to run on the same machine as the service you are exposing. To forward to another service, you 
will need to set the host header to "rewrite" or have it match the address you are going to "myservice.genesys.com". 
[https://ngrok.com/docs#host-header](https://ngrok.com/docs#host-header)

```{"language":"bash"}
  #Example ~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml
  authtoken: xxx
  tunnels:
    myservice:
      proto: http
      bind_tls: true
      subdomain: actions
      host_header: rewrite
      addr: myservice.genesys.com
```{"language":" "}
*  ngrok will default to using their US region cloud. If you are not in the US, you should specify the region in your config. 
  [https://ngrok.com/docs#global-locations](https://ngrok.com/docs#global-locations)
*  TLS/HTTPS tunnels will terminate on the ngrok servers. Because of this, there is extra work you will have to do if you want to use HTTPS between ngrok and your locally running service.  

#### Secure Connection With Certificate Warnings
This configuration will create a HTTPS address, that forwards traffic to your service, via HTTPS as well.  Because the 
TLS connection is terminated on ngrok, a new secure connection is made between ngrok and your service.  This results in 
an "insecure certificate warning" because your local service does not know how to resolve a certificate coming from the 
ngrok domain (ngrok.io).  If you are using something like curl, you can use the _**--insecure**_ flag to ignore this warning. 

```{"language":"bash"}
  #Example ~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml
  authtoken: xxx
  tunnels:
    mySecureService:
      proto: tls
      addr: localhost:443
      subdomain: actions
```{"language":" "}

#### Secure Connection Without Certificate Warnings
This setup will require $$$ and more setup time. 
 
1. Buy a SSL (TLS) certificate for a domain name that you own 
2. Configure your local web server to use that certificate and its private key to terminate TLS connections
3. Create a custom domain in ngrok, that matches the domain on your certificate.  [https://ngrok.com/docs#custom-domains](https://ngrok.com/docs#custom-domains)
4. Make sure ngrok tunnel configurations include the region you are in, and hostname 

```{"language":"bash"}
  #Example ~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml
  authtoken: xxx
  tunnels:
    mySecureServiceWithoutWarnings:
      proto: tls
      region: us
      hostname: secureService.genesys.com
```{"language":" "}

#### Best Practice
If a company is going the distance to buy a certificate, manage a web server, etc, then their service is most likely exposed to the 
internet. If this is the case, then you do not need ngrok and can configure your custom action(s) to use your publicly accessible endpoint.
