# Contributing

1. Fork the Genesys Cloud Developer Center Blog repository to your GitHub account
2. Create a new folder for your article in the `source` directory using the following format `YYYY-MM-DD-blog-post-title`
    1. The title in the folder name should be kept to 5 words or less, must not contain spaces, and should use lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes only
    2. The index file and all images must reside directly in this folder; no subfolders are permitted
4. Within the new folder, create an `index.md` file and write your article in this file
5. Submit a pull request to merge the changes to the origin/master
  
**Note**: If you are a first-time author, include your bio and image in a comment in the Pull Request (PR). For more information, see the Content Guidelines section.

## Content guidelines

* Blog posts must be related to Genesys Cloud
* No private/sensitive/NDA information; All content will be visible publicly on the internet.
* The target audience is prospective and existing Genesys Cloud customers with an entry-level to expert technical background. All blog posts should be relatively technical.
* If appropriate, include 1-3 images to make the blog post more visually appealing.
* Keep it professional; lighthearted humor is fine; no cursing, politics, or Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content.

## Authoring tips

* Do not use h1 headers; the title is inserted as an h1, and any section headers below that should start with h2 (markdown ##).
* Anything before the first page (frontmatter) will be used as the summary
* Images can be included in your article folder and markdown using `![alt text](image.png "Logo Title Text 1")`
* Blog posts will not be published until the date in the folder name has elapsed (on or after)
