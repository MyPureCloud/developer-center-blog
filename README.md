## Content Guidelines

* Blog posts must be related to PureCloud in some way
* No private/sensitive/NDA-required information; All content will be visible publicly on the internet.
* The target audience for the blog is prospective and existing PureCloud customers with an entry-level to expert technical background. All blog posts should be at least somewhat technical in nature.
* If appropriate, try to include 1-3 images to make the blog post more visually appealing.
* Keep it professional; lighthearted humor is fine, but no cursing, politics, or NSFW content.

## Markdown tips

* Don't use h1 headers in your article, the title is inserted as a h1 and any section headers below that should start at h2 (markdown ##)
* Code blocks should be surrounded by ~~~ unlike the backticks used in Github Markdown
* Images can be included in your article folder and included in markdown using ~~~![alt text](image.png "Logo Title Text 1")~~~

## Running locally

To run locally, you first need [Ruby installed](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) as well as [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).  

1. Pull the repo locally, ```cd``` into the directory
2. Run ```bundle install``` to grab all the needed ruby gems.
3. Run ```startServer.sh``` or ```bundle exec middleman server```.  This will start a web app running on port 4567 using the same markdown engine that is used a build time. There will not be any css styling with this local site as we store all those assets in a different repository.
